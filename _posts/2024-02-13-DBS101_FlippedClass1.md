### Topic: Database User and Database Administrators
---
On February 13th, we had a 2-hour flipped class. During that time, I learned about the different types of database users and the roles and responsibilities of Database Administrators.

Here are some of the database users I learned:

1. Parametric End Users: These are individuals who lack sufficient knowledge about DBMS (Database Management System) but frequently use database applications. Examples like clerks in a bank.

2. System Analysts: These professionals analyze the requirements of parametric end users or naive users, ensuring that the needs for the end users are met.

3. Sophisticated Users: These are individuals who are familiar with databases, such as scientists or engineers, who develop their own database applications according to their specific requirements, interacting with SQL (Structured Query Language) queries.

4. Database Designers: Their role is to design the structure of the database, which includes tables and other components.

5. Application Programmers: These individuals develop computer software specifically designed to assist users in performing specific tasks.

6. Casual or Temporary Users: These are users who infrequently use the database but require different information each time.

7. Specialized Users: These are sophisticated users who write specialized database applications.

Some of the roles and responsibilities of Database Administrators (DBAs) include:

1. Ensuring that databases operate smoothly and efficiently.

2. Managing databases and performing tasks such as designing, securing, optimizing performance, backing up data, and recovering it.


During the flipped class, we were initially divided into home groups where we discussed various types of database users. Following this, we were then divided into expert groups to share our thoughts and discussions from the home groups.

To enhance the flipped class, I would recommend the tutor to ask questions to each individual after the discussion, allocate more time for discussions, and allow the team to present something after class.
