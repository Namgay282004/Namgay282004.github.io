### Topic: Entity Realtionship Model of a real world system.

Hello, dear reader, it was a late evening when my friend mentioned about my presentation during the flipped class. This news made me want to write about it in my journal. So, I started this entry to share my learning experience.

In the flipped class, I learned about the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. This model uses diagrams to show how datas are connected in databases. I was interested in 'cardinalities,' which show how entities are related. We use crow's foot to show these relationships. For example, a house can have one owner, so it's a one-to-one relationship. I also learned about 'participation conditions,' which can be 'mandatory' or 'optional.' This has helped me understand how datas are linked in databases.Our tutor also highlighted 'primary keys.' Primary keys are attributes that help uniquely identify the tuples in the table.

We were split into six groups of four people each. We had to draw an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for different real-world systems like Online Health Booking, Airline Ticketing, Mobile Banking Application, Student Management System, Bus Booking, and Voter Registration. For the first 50 minutes, we discussed about our chosen topics.

Our group picked the Mobile Banking Application. We figured outthe entities and attributes. Then, we drew the ER diagram to show how those were connected. We also identified the cardinalities between the entities.

After 50 minutes, it was time to show our work to the class. Each group presented their ER diagram and explained their system. I found all the presentations interesting and learned a lot from them.

Our tutor asked questions to make sure we understood everything. This helped us think more about what we had learned and how it could be used in real life.The presentations went on until the last group talked about the Airline Ticketing system.

To enhance the flipped class session, I would recommend that the tutor guide throughout the discussion time in order to keep students on track. One thing I liked about our Tuesday flipped class is that our tutor, Miss Palden, was there to clear our doubts while we were facing difficulties. Miss Palden also asked questions after every presentation, which was particularly helpful to me. Such involvement helps learners to understand more and retain information for a longer time.
